## How to run locally

Download [the carts] and unpack them into a subdirectory in your carts folder. You can find this folder by executing a `FOLDER` command in Pico-8. Assuming you named the subdirectory `badapple`, your carts directory should look something like this:

[the carts]: https://github.com/iliazeus/pico8-badapp/releases/latest/download/carts.zip

```
┬─ carts
└┬─ badapple
 ├─ data_0.p8
 ├─ data_1.p8
 ...
 └─ play.p8
```
