Punk-o-Matic 2 is a piece of Flash software that allows people to compose their own punk and punk-adjacent rock songs by stringing together lots of pre-recorded riffs and drum patterns. You can still download it from its [official website], or play it [on Newgrounds].

[on newgrounds]: https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/525045

One of its important features is song sharing: you can export your creation as a bunch of text-based codes and post it on a forum somewhere, then other people can import it to check it out. There also used to be a website, punk-o-matic.net, that was a hub for sharing such songs, but it is no longer active.

On this page there are some of the good Punk-o-Matic 2 songs I salvaged from various places, in no particular order. Made possible using [punkomatic-js], a piece of software I wrote that can play those song codes in your web browser.
